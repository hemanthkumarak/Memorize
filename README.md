# Memorize

A playground repository from the CS193p course taught by the genius, Paul Hegarty.

For those just getting started with iOS, i would suggest checking out the latest version of the CS193p playlist, [here is the 2021 Spring class on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpGHT1n4-mAsxuRxVPv7kj4-dQYoC3VVu)

The pre-requisites are pretty simple, you should be able to follow along the concepts taught in CS106a or CS106x and be comfortable with building and manipulating basic data structures.

For the pre requisites, if this is your first time writing code, i would suggest hitting up the incredible Mehran Sehamis lectures at Stanford. [Here is a playlist from back in the day with the CS106a lectures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL84A56BC7F4A1F852)

To set expectations, this lecture series in CS193p is not for advanced devs, but more targeted at beginners to the mid level. You will learn the concepts of manipulating data structures to build a basic interface that works on device, using device assisted compute and the primary elements of the iOS library. The most powerful learning you will have though is to go through the process of iteration while building simple applications. Refactoring code, writing useable UI elements, understanding the components of Swift UI etc.
